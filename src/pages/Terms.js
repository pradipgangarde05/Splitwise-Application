        Splitwise is a shared ledger for friends, colleagues and family to keep
        track of expenses. Bills, IOUs, debts and payments recorded on Splitwise
        are informal records, and not legally binding contracts of some kind. We
        offer the Splitwise service "as-is" without a warranty. Splitwise® is a
        work-in-progress, so some features of our website and apps may not work
        exactly as planned. We may stop offering or restrict certain services or
        features at any time. Please be patient with us and we'll always do our
        best to support you.

        We will modify our Terms Of Use and
        <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> periodically and post the most
        current version on this webpage,
        <a href="/terms">https://www.splitwise.com/terms</a>. Here are the

            <strong>Who can use Splitwise:</strong> You may use our services
            only if you agree to these Terms of Service and to the processing of
            your information as described in our
            <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. You may not use Splitwise if
            you are barred from receiving services under the laws of the

            <strong>Description:</strong> Splitwise® (the Service) is a service
            designed to help you track informal debts, expenses, and bills, by
            allowing users to enter notes about who they owe, who owes them and
            why. The Service keeps track of the sharing math, provides informal
            sharing advice, and stores this data for later use. You agree that
            this service is provided AS-IS and on an AS AVAILABLE basis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Informal debts:</strong> The website allows users who share
            a group or are friends on the service to post debts and payments as
            they please, using wiki-style rules with no explicit permissions.
            These are calculated into a determination of debts by the Service.
            You agree that you understand these debts are not legally binding,
            and represent informal information sharing among roommates, friends,
            or family. You agree that the Service cannot guarantee the accuracy
            of information entered by users.
